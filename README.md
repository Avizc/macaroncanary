# Macaron Canary

Currently a solo-project on tracking transparency reports for warrant canaries and auto-updating their status after if there are changes. A project using Python and Beautiful Soup.

## How to use

Check an individual site to see when the transparency report was last updated, if the warrant canary was up/down, and an estimate on when it should be updated again. A log of previous canaries and their status should be there for each site if possible.

## What is a warrant canary?

> "A warrant canary is a method by which a communications service provider aims to inform its users that the provider has not been served with a secret government subpoena." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary)

> "When a warrant canary "dies" (disappears, is not updated, etc.), provider no longer makes the statement about the number of such process received." - [Canary Watch](https://canarywatch.org/faq.html)

Essentially the warrant canary is a statement put out by a company on their transparency report if they have *not* received a secret government subpoena such as a National Security Letter (NSL).

### National Security Letter (NSL)

NSLs have been around since the 1970s. Since the Patriot Act of 2001 the frequency at which they have been issued and served has dramatically increased to a peak (so far) of over 50,000 in a single year. The FBI can issue NSLs without any judicial oversight.

## Why am I doing this project?

I've had an interest in warrant canaries for quite some time but my interest in creating the project sparked up when in May of 2016 [Canary Watch](https://canarywatch.org/) was discontinued. I envision an end goal of eventually giving each company a "profile" that would be updated with changes/removals in the transparency reports with the aide of users in the event something does not automatically update.

## Can I request a site be added to the project?

Yes! Please do that over in Requests under Documentation via a pull request.

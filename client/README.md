This project on the public end is currently set up with the intention of being done with the following:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)

In light of clarified news that React's license is [indeed the Facebook BSD+Patents license](https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license) I am feeling rather uncomfortable with the idea of continuing my usage of React albeit my excitement for Redux and the possible opportunities that are coming up with React. While React is currently part of my main stack I will now be looking at other options which I hope to quickly find soon to resolve my dilemma.
